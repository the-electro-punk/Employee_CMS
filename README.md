# Employee_CMS

# Description

This is a javascript code that takes data about an employee and submits it to a MySQL database/table. The javascript code, named "node-input.js", is designed to link up with a database, "gizmonic", in MySQL workbench. While I had previous experience learning SQL, I had to relearn some things to make this work properly; that said, I feel I did a decent job here and hopefully can create a more elaborate features in the future (such as inputting which database to use first)

# How to use the project

Within the node-input.js file, open the command line and type "node node-input.js". This will open a list of questions asking the table name (in this case "emplist" from the Gizmonic database), employee ID, employee name, employee's job/position (IE: IT Specialist), and finally employee's department (IE: Human Resources). For this specific code, it is linked with a premade database located on my computer; as such, anyone wanting to use this code may need to create a database of their own and link the javascript file to it.

# Credits

While I was the sole person working most of these assignments, I usually received help from classmates, instructors, and online tutorials for help better understanding certain concepts
